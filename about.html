    <h2>About the Report Card</h2>

    <p>
      The <strong>Active Healthy Kids Pakistan Report Card</strong> is a comprehensive evidence‑based evaluation of the movement behaviours and related health indicators among children and youth in Pakistan. Building on international best practices, the Report Card aims to consolidate the best available data, propose grades for each indicator, promote international comparability, and catalyse action for improved physical activity opportunities in Pakistan.
    </p>

    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>
      This Report Card brings together data from national surveys, peer‑reviewed studies, government reports and grey literature to provide a summary of how children and youth in Pakistan are performing across a range of physical activity and health‑related behaviours and contexts. It aims to inform policy, guide research priorities, support education and advocacy, and ultimately encourage a healthier, more active generation.
    </p>

    <h3>Indicator Framework</h3>
    <p>
      We use a harmonised framework encompassing behavioural indicators (such as overall physical activity, organised sport participation, active play, active transportation, sedentary behaviour and sleep), sources of influence (such as family & peers, school, community & environment, government strategies) and outcome indicators (such as physical fitness, and childhood obesity). Each indicator is graded on a letter‑scale (A+ to F, or INC for incomplete data) according to pre‑defined benchmarks. For example, an A+ denotes that 94‑100 % of children meet the benchmark, whereas an F signifies that less than 20 % do so. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
    </p>

    <h3>Methodology</h3>
    <p>
      An expert working group comprised of researchers and academics reviewed all available data for children and youth in Pakistan (typically aged 5‑17 years) over the past 10 years. Data sources meeting the following criteria were included: (1) the study or report targeted children and/or adolescents in Pakistan; (2) it assessed one or more of the Report Card indicators; and (3) data collection was conducted within the past ten years. Qualitative stakeholder input was sought to ensure context‑relevant interpretation.
    </p>

    <h3>Assigning Grades</h3>
    <p>
      For each indicator, the working group discussed the evidence, applied the benchmarks, and arrived at a proposed grade that was further reviewed in stakeholder consultation. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}
    </p>

    <h3>Dissemination and Use</h3>
    <p>
      The findings from this Report Card are intended for a wide audience, including policy‑makers, educators, practitioners, researchers and the general public. They are published online, shared via media and presented to key stakeholders. The goal is to stimulate dialogue, influence monitoring systems, strengthen surveillance, inform practice and policy, and provide a benchmark for future editions.
    </p>

    <h3>Next Steps</h3>
    <p>
      Moving forward, we aim to update the Report Card at regular intervals (e.g., every 2‑3 years) and strengthen national surveillance systems in Pakistan. We will actively engage with schools, communities and government partners to promote interventions, track change over time and expand the evidence base for children’s physical activity and health.
